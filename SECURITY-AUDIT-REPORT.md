### 5. Database Security âœ…

#### Security Features:
- SSL/TLS encrypted connections required
- Dedicated application user with minimal privileges
- Row-level security enabled
- Connection pooling with timeouts
- Comprehensive audit logging

#### Database Schema Security:
- New security tables: `SecurityEvent`, `LoginAttempt`, `RateLimit`, `AuditLog`
- Indexed queries for performance
- Automated audit triggers for data modifications

### 6. Secrets Management âœ…

#### Critical Fixes:
- **âœ… Removed**: `ctx7sk-515f031f-3892-41d1-8cd7-35af160e72d8` from all templates
- **âœ… Removed**: All hardcoded API keys and secrets
- **âœ… Implemented**: Proper environment variable validation
- **âœ… Created**: Separate production environment template

#### Current Implementation:
- Environment-specific configurations
- Strong JWT secret requirements (256+ bits)
- API key format validation without exposure
- No secrets in version control

### 7. Production Infrastructure Security âœ…

#### Container Security:
- Multi-stage Docker builds for minimal attack surface
- Non-root user execution (UID 1001)
- Read-only filesystems where possible
- Security scanning with Trivy

#### Network Security:
- NGINX reverse proxy with security configurations
- HTTPS enforcement with HTTP redirects
- Modern TLS 1.2/1.3 only
- HSTS headers with preload directive

### 8. Monitoring & Incident Response âœ…

#### Comprehensive Monitoring:
- **Health Endpoint**: `/api/health` with detailed system checks
- **Security Endpoint**: `/api/security/status` for threat monitoring
- **Audit Logging**: Structured security event logging
- **Alert Integration**: Webhook notifications for critical events

#### Automated Security Response:
- Real-time rate limiting enforcement
- Security event classification by severity
