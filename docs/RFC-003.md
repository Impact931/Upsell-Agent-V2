After reviewing the proposed changes and the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD), I've drafted RFC-003 to reflect the new direction for the Upsell Agent project. The PRD, "Upsell Agent PRD v1.5 - MVP Focused," is a great starting point, but it needs to be updated to align with these new requirements before the RFC is submitted. The new changes would significantly alter the project scope and feature set, making it crucial to have an updated PRD as the source of truth for all stakeholders.

RFC-003: Upsell Agent Project Refinements
BLUF: This RFC proposes a refined scope for the Upsell Agent project's MVP. The goal is to focus on the core value proposition by removing non-essential features, improving the UI/UX, and enhancing the quality of the AI-generated output and its presentation. This will streamline development, improve the user experience, and ensure a more focused and polished final product.

Problem
The current plan for the Upsell Agent project includes features like Staff Management and Financial Tracking. While valuable, these features are outside the core MVP scope of generating sales training materials. Including them could lead to feature creep, delaying the launch and diluting the focus on the primary value loop. Additionally, the existing UI and output presentation need to be optimized for readability and ease of use, particularly for staff who will be using the materials on mobile devices. The current AI process also has a misalignment with the PRD, requiring a re-evaluation to ensure the output meets the intended user needs.

Proposal
The proposed solution involves a targeted set of changes to simplify the project and enhance the user experience.

Scope Reduction: Remove the "Staff Management" and "Financial Tracking" modules from the MVP. These will be logged as future enhancements, allowing the team to concentrate on the core functionality. This directly addresses the MVP Timeline risk and Feature Creep mentioned in the PRD.

UI/UX Alignment: The entire user interface and main menu will be centered on the webpage for a clean, modern aesthetic and improved user experience.

Output Bundling and Presentation:

The generated output for each product (FAQ, Script, Objection Handling, and Product Guide) will be bundled into a single folder named after the product.

Clicking on the product folder will reveal the individual documents.

Each document (Script, Objections, FAQ, Product Guide) will be displayed in a beautifully formatted, HTML-based viewer. The display blocks will feature the Main Product Name prominently at the top.

A "Download PDF" button will be included on each document's viewing page, providing a secondary format for offline use. This addresses the "Mobile Staff Interface" and "Output Delivery" goals in the PRD.

AI Process Correction: The AI workflow will be updated to align with the PRD's validated process:

Evaluate the Upsell Item.

Determine pain points for potential beneficiaries.

Develop three unique Ideal Client Profiles (ICPs). These will be dynamically generated, not hardcoded templates.

Create a script and a strategic approach that speaks directly to the ICPs.

This refined approach ensures that the project remains focused on its core Value Proposition and delivers a polished, high-quality product that directly addresses the validated Pain Points of its target users.

Alternatives
Option A (Status Quo): Proceed with all features outlined in the original PRD, including Staff Management and Financial Tracking.

Pros: Delivers a more comprehensive product with a wider feature set.

Cons: High risk of feature creep, potential for delays in the MVP launch, and a less polished core product. This would contradict the Key Simplifications from v1 outlined in the PRD.

Option B (Chosen): Refine the scope to focus on the core value proposition.

Pros: Streamlines development, reduces time-to-market, improves the quality of the core features, and provides a better user experience for the MVP. This aligns with the PRD's MVP Focused approach and the Phase 1 MVP Features section.

Cons: Defers valuable features to a later phase.

Risks
Technical Risk: The dynamic generation of ICPs and detailed scripts may require more complex prompt engineering than the current template-based approach.

Mitigation: The team will need to spend dedicated time on prompt engineering and testing to ensure consistent and high-quality outputs that align with the business analysis.

Timeline Risk: The time required to implement the new UI layout and HTML rendering may cause minor delays.

Mitigation: The UI/UX designer and frontend developer will prioritize this work, leveraging a component-based approach and existing styling frameworks like Tailwind CSS to expedite development.

Open Questions
[ ] What is the final decision on the specific design for the HTML output viewing pages?

[ ] Do we need to update the success metrics in the PRD to reflect the changes in the AI process?

Success Metrics
User Onboarding Completion Rate: >80% (Carried over from PRD)

Time to First Successful Training Document: <10 minutes (Carried over from PRD)

Manager Satisfaction Rating: >4/5 (Carried over from PRD)

AI Output Quality Score: A new metric to be established to evaluate the quality of the dynamically generated ICPs and scripts based on a standardized rubric. Target: >85%

Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Scope Refinement & UI (Estimated 1-2 weeks)

Week 1: Update the PRD to reflect the changes and finalize design mockups for the new UI centering and output presentation.

Week 2: Front-end team begins implementation of the new UI layout, centered menu, and placeholder output bundling folders.

Phase 2: Output Rendering & AI Refinement (Estimated 2-3 weeks)

Week 3: Back-end team begins working on the folder bundling logic.

Week 4: Front-end team builds the HTML viewer with a "Download PDF" button for each document. The AI team begins refining the prompts for dynamic ICP and script generation.

Week 5: Full integration of the AI output into the new UI, and testing of the new workflow.

Phase 3: QA & Deployment (Estimated 1 week)

Final quality assurance and bug fixes.

Deployment to the pilot salons for validation.
