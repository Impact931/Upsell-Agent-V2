## Dependency Management

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Architecture → Frontend**: API specs must be complete before frontend integration
2. **UI/UX → Frontend**: Design system required before component implementation
3. **Backend → Business**: Core functionality needed before pilot salon testing
4. **Business → All**: Compliance requirements affect all implementation

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Parallel Development Approach**:
- Frontend can begin with mock data while backend APIs are developed
- UI components can be built against design specs while backend integration follows
- Business validation can prepare with prototypes while full implementation continues

**Buffer Management**:
- 20% time buffer built into each work stream
- Cross-training between agents to handle resource constraints
- Modular development allowing for independent component completion

**Quality Gates**:
- Daily sync between interdependent streams
- Weekly integration testing of combined components
- Continuous validation against business requirements

## Coordination Mechanisms

### Daily Standup Format
**Participants**: All active agents + Context Manager
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Format**:
1. **Progress Report** (2 min per agent): What was completed yesterday
2. **Today's Plan** (1 min per agent): Primary focus for today
3. **Blockers** (as needed): Issues preventing progress
4. **Coordination** (remaining time): Integration points and dependencies

### Weekly Integration Review
**Participants**: Primary agents from each stream + specialists as needed
**Duration**: 45 minutes
**Agenda**:
1. **Integration Point Status**: Review scheduled handoffs
2. **Cross-Stream Impact**: Changes affecting other work streams
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential issues early
4. **Timeline Adjustment**: Modify schedules based on progress
5. **Next Week Planning**: Coordinate upcoming work

### Milestone Checkpoints
**Format**: Comprehensive review at each major milestone
**Participants**: All agents + stakeholders
**Process**:
1. **Deliverable Review**: Validate completion criteria
2. **Integration Testing**: Confirm components work together
3. **Business Validation**: Ensure alignment with requirements
4. **Next Phase Planning**: Prepare for upcoming work
