- **Days 20-21**: Analysis, recommendation, and launch decision

## Success Metrics Framework

### Technical Success Criteria
- [ ] 95% file upload success rate
- [ ] <5 minute training material generation
- [ ] <5 second training material display
- [ ] Mobile responsive across iOS/Android devices
- [ ] 99.9% system uptime during pilot

### Business Success Criteria  
- [ ] 3-5 pilot salons successfully onboarded
- [ ] 15-20% revenue lift demonstrated in pilot
- [ ] >4/5 user satisfaction rating
