# Agent Briefing: Backend Architect - Foundation Setup

## Context Summary
- **Project Phase**: Initialization & Foundation Setup (Week 1)
- **Previous Work**: Project context framework established, prePRD requirements defined
- **Current State**: Ready for technical architecture design and implementation

## Specific Task
**Primary Objective**: Design and implement the core backend architecture for the Upsell Agent MVP, focusing on file processing, AI integration, and data management.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Complete system architecture document with technology justifications
- [ ] Database schema designed and implemented with migrations
- [ ] OpenAI API integration functional for training material generation
- [ ] File upload and OCR processing pipeline operational
- [ ] JWT authentication backend implementation complete
- [ ] Core API endpoints defined and documented (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Development environment setup documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met: <5 min training generation, >95% upload success

**Timeline**: 5 days (Days 1-5 of project)

## Technical Requirements

### Core Architecture Decisions Needed
1. **Database Technology**: PostgreSQL vs MongoDB vs SQLite for MVP
   - Consider: Spa/salon data relationships, file metadata storage, user management
   - Requirement: Support for 100+ concurrent users in production

2. **File Storage Strategy**: Local filesystem vs cloud storage vs hybrid
   - Consider: OCR processing requirements, file security, scalability
   - Requirement: 95% upload success rate, secure file handling

3. **API Design**: RESTful vs GraphQL vs hybrid approach
   - Consider: Frontend complexity, mobile responsiveness, caching needs
   - Requirement: <200ms response time for core operations

4. **Authentication Architecture**: JWT implementation strategy
   - Consider: Token refresh, role management (manager/staff), security
   - Requirement: No OAuth in V1, secure but simple implementation

### Core Features to Implement

#### 1. File Processing Pipeline
```typescript
// Expected API contract
POST /api/files/upload
- Multipart file upload with validation
- OCR processing integration
- Metadata extraction and storage
- Error handling and retry logic
- Progress tracking for long operations

GET /api/files/{fileId}/status
- Processing status and progress
- OCR results when complete
- Error details if processing failed
```

#### 2. AI Training Generation
```typescript
// Expected API contract  
POST /api/training/generate
- Input: processed file data + customization options
- Integration: OpenAI API with validated prompts
- Output: structured training materials
- Compliance: automatic disclaimer injection
- Performance: <5 minute generation time

GET /api/training/{trainingId}
- Retrieve generated training materials
- Support for different formats (text, structured)
- Mobile-optimized content delivery
```

#### 3. User Management
```typescript
// Expected API contract
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/refresh
DELETE /api/auth/logout

GET /api/users/profile
PUT /api/users/profile
- Basic role management (manager/staff)
- Salon/business association
- Profile management
```

### Integration Requirements

#### OpenAI API Integration
- **Model Selection**: GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo based on cost/performance analysis
- **Prompt Engineering**: Templates for consistent, compliant training material generation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, retry logic, fallback options
- **Cost Management**: Usage tracking, rate limiting, optimization strategies

#### OCR Processing
- **Technology Options**: Tesseract.js (client-side) vs cloud OCR services
- **File Format Support**: PDF, JPG, PNG, DOC at minimum
- **Accuracy Requirements**: Sufficient for spa/salon product documentation
- **Performance**: Balance accuracy vs speed for user experience

#### Security Implementation
- **JWT Strategy**: Access/refresh token pattern, secure storage recommendations
- **Data Protection**: File encryption, secure deletion, privacy compliance
- **Input Validation**: File type validation, size limits, content scanning
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, CORS configuration, input sanitization

## Resources Available

### Existing Files
- `/Users/jhrstudio/Documents/GitHub/Upsell-Agent-V2/docs/context/ Upsell-Agent prePRD Brief.md` - Business requirements
- `/Users/jhrstudio/Documents/GitHub/Upsell-Agent-V2/package.json` - Current project setup
- `/Users/jhrstudio/Documents/GitHub/Upsell-Agent-V2/docs/agents/development-team/backend-architect.md` - Your agent profile

### Available Tools
- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: For complex architectural analysis and problem-solving
- **Context7 MCP**: For context management across the implementation process
- **Development Environment**: Next.js/TypeScript foundation available

### Team Resources
- **Database Architect** (on-call): For complex query optimization and schema design
- **Security Auditor** (scheduled): For security review at end of Week 2
- **Frontend Developer** (parallel): Will consume your API specifications

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Stack Limitation**: Must use Next.js/TypeScript/OpenAI stack
- **Authentication**: JWT only, no OAuth in V1
- **File Processing**: Browser-based OCR preferred to avoid server complexity
- **Database**: Should support easy migration to cloud providers later

### Business Constraints
- **Compliance**: No medical claims, must include wellness marketing disclaimers
- **Performance**: <5 minute training generation, <200ms API response times
- **Reliability**: >95% file upload success rate, 99.9% uptime target
- **Budget**: Minimize infrastructure costs for MVP, optimize for pilot salon needs

### Timeline Constraints
- **Hard Deadline**: Day 5 for foundation completion
- **Integration Deadline**: API specs must be ready by Day 3 for frontend integration
- **Testing Window**: Allow 1 day for integration testing before frontend handoff
