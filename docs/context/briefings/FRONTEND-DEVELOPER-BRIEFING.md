### Integration Requirements

#### Backend API Integration
```typescript
// API integration patterns
interface ApiClient {
  // Authentication
  auth: {
    login(credentials: LoginCredentials): Promise<AuthResponse>
    register(userData: RegistrationData): Promise<User>
    refresh(): Promise<TokenResponse>
    logout(): Promise<void>
  }
  
  // File operations
  files: {
    upload(file: File, onProgress?: (progress: number) => void): Promise<FileResponse>
    getStatus(fileId: string): Promise<ProcessingStatus>
    getProcessed(fileId: string): Promise<ProcessedFile>
  }
  
  // Training materials
  training: {
    generate(fileId: string, options: GenerationOptions): Promise<TrainingJob>
    getTraining(trainingId: string): Promise<TrainingMaterial>
    listTraining(): Promise<TrainingMaterial[]>
  }
}
```

#### State Management Strategy
- **Authentication State**: User session, tokens, permissions
- **Upload State**: File processing status, progress tracking
- **Training State**: Generated materials, favorites, history
- **UI State**: Loading states, error handling, notifications

### User Experience Requirements

#### Responsive Design Breakpoints
- **Mobile First**: 320px+ (primary staff access)
- **Tablet**: 768px+ (manager interface)
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (full admin features)
- **Large Screen**: 1440px+ (multi-panel layouts)

#### Accessibility Requirements
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Focus management, keyboard navigation
- **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels
- **Color Contrast**: Meet accessibility contrast ratios
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear focus states for keyboard users
- **Alternative Text**: Proper alt text for images and icons
