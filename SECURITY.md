### 6. Production Hardening

#### Container Security
- Multi-stage Docker builds for minimal attack surface
- Non-root user execution (user ID 1001)
- Read-only root filesystem where possible
- Security scanning with Trivy vulnerability scanner
- Distroless base images for production

#### Network Security
- NGINX reverse proxy with security configurations
- HTTPS enforcement with HTTP to HTTPS redirects
- Modern TLS configuration (TLS 1.2/1.3 only)
- Security-focused cipher suites
- HSTS headers with preload directive

### 7. Monitoring & Alerting

#### Health Monitoring
- Comprehensive health check endpoint (`/api/health`)
- Database connectivity monitoring
- Memory usage tracking with thresholds
- File system write capability verification
- Security configuration validation

#### Security Monitoring
- Dedicated security status endpoint (`/api/security/status`)
- Real-time security event tracking
- Failed login attempt monitoring
- Rate limit violation alerting
- Automated threat detection and response

#### Logging
- Structured logging with Winston
- Separate security event log file
- Log rotation with size and time-based policies
- Centralized error handling and reporting
- Performance monitoring with request tracing

### 8. Deployment Security

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated security scanning in GitHub Actions
- Dependency vulnerability checking with audit-ci
- Container security scanning before deployment
- Staging environment security verification
- Production deployment with rollback capability

#### Infrastructure Security
- Docker Compose production configuration
- Encrypted data volumes
- Network isolation with bridge networking
- Automated database backups with encryption
- Health check integration for container orchestration

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. **SSL Certificates**: Obtain valid SSL certificates for HTTPS
2. **Database Setup**: Configure PostgreSQL with SSL enabled
3. **Environment Variables**: Set all required production environment variables
4. **Monitoring**: Set up external monitoring and alerting systems

### Deployment Steps

1. **Build Production Images**:
   ```bash
   docker build -f Dockerfile.prod -t upsell-agent:prod .
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.production.example .env.production
   # Edit .env.production with actual production values
   ```

3. **Deploy with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Verify Security Configuration**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://yourdomain.com/api/security/status
   ```

### Security Checklist

- [ ] JWT_SECRET is strong (256+ bits) and unique
- [ ] All API keys are properly externalized
- [ ] SSL certificates are valid and configured
- [ ] Database connections use SSL/TLS
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured for production
- [ ] Security headers are properly set
- [ ] Log monitoring is configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are tested
- [ ] Security monitoring alerts are configured

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Run security test suite
npm run test -- src/tests/unit/security.test.ts

# Run dependency audit
npm audit

# Run container security scan
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  aquasec/trivy:latest image upsell-agent:prod
```

### Manual Security Testing
1. **Authentication Testing**: Verify JWT token validation
2. **Authorization Testing**: Test role-based access controls  
3. **Input Validation**: Test with malicious payloads
4. **Rate Limiting**: Verify rate limits are enforced
5. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Confirm HTTP redirects work
6. **Security Headers**: Validate all security headers are present

## üìä Security Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- Failed authentication attempts per hour
- Rate limit violations per day
- Security events by severity level
- Average response time for security checks
- Database connection health status
- SSL certificate expiration monitoring

### Alerting Thresholds
- **CRITICAL**: 5+ failed logins from same IP in 10 minutes
- **HIGH**: SQL injection attempts detected
- **MEDIUM**: Rate limits exceeded by same IP 3+ times
- **LOW**: Unusual access patterns detected

## üÜò Incident Response

### Security Event Response
1. **Immediate**: Log security event with full context
2. **Assessment**: Classify severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Apply automatic rate limiting/blocking if needed
4. **Investigation**: Review logs and trace attack vectors
5. **Recovery**: Restore services and implement additional protections
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures based on findings
